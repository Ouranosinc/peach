Documentation for climate-hazards-analysis
==========================================

This is the documentation for the `climate-hazards-analysis` project. The project tries to answer the question:

  How likely is it that a climate hazard will exceed a threshold over a given period of time?

This documentation is intended for

- developers who want to deploy the services, and
- advanced users looking for programmatic access to the services.

Note that most of the documentation is in english, but some parts are in french.
