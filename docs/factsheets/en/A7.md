# The statistical distribution of extreme values and the Gumbel distribution {#sec-A7}

The probabilities of the occurrence of the extreme values in a
stationary random series are often represented by the Gumbel
distribution, which is a particular case^[The Gumbel distribution corresponds to the case where the shape parameter
of the generalized extreme value distribution is set to zero.] of the generalized extreme value
distribution^[The use of the Gumbel distribution and the generalized extreme value
distribution is based on theoretical considerations. Readers who
want more details can consult @coles2001.].
The Gumbel distribution is used by Environment
and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in the construction of
Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves^[For more details, see [Engineering Climate Datasets](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/prods_servs/engineering_e.html).],
among other things. The
probability density function^[The probability density function $f(x)$ defines the probability that
 the value x is equal to a given value. Thus, $f(x)$ dx is the
 probability that x is included in the interval $[x,x + dx]$.] of the Gumbel distribution,
$f_{G}\left( x \right)$, is as follows:
$$
f_{G}(x) = \sigma^{-1} z \exp(-z)
$$
with:
$$
z = \exp \left[ \frac{-(x - \mu)}{\sigma} \right]
$$
where $\mu$ is the position parameter and $\sigma$ the scale parameter
of the distribution.^[ The mean of the Gumbel distribution is $\mu + \sigma\gamma$ where
    $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant ($\gamma \approx 0,5772$
    and the variance is given by $\frac{\pi^{2}\sigma^{2}}{6}$.]
The corresponding distribution function^[The cumulative distribution function $F\left( x \right)$ defines the probability that the variable X is less than the value x, i.e. $P\left( X < x \right) = F\left( x \right)$.] is given by:
$$
F_{G}(x) = \exp(-z)
$$
The method of moments^[Several other estimation methods exist and have certain advantages
    over the method of moments (e.g. maximum likelihood estimation or
    the L-moment method). The method of moments is the one used by
    ECCC to create IDF curves in Canada.] can be used to estimate the Gumbel distribution
parameters for a given series. If $\overline{x}$ and s are the mean and
standard deviation of the series, then the position parameters
$\hat{\mu}$ and the scale parameters $\hat{\sigma}$ of the Gumbel
distribution fitted to this series are obtained from the following
expressions:
$$
\begin{align}
\widehat{\sigma} &= \sqrt{6} \left( \frac{s}{\pi} \right) \\
\widehat{\mu} &= \overline{x} - \frac{\sqrt{6} \gamma s}{\pi}
\end{align}
$$
where $\gamma$ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant
($\gamma \approx 0.5772$). Lastly, we can estimate a quantile for a
given return period T (in years) by inverting the distribution function
$F$:
$$
X = \widehat{\mu} - \widehat{\sigma} \ln \left[ - \ln \left( 1 - \frac{1}{T} \right) \right]
$$

The Gumbel distribution was fitted to the values of the series of annual
maximum daily precipitation values at the Jean-Lesage Airport^[The Jean-Lesage Airport station (7016294-701S001) is operated by  Environment and Climate Change Canada.] station
in Quebec (@fig-A7a). The values of the position and scale parameters
after fitting are $\hat{\mu} = 46.1$ and $\hat{\sigma} = 10.9$. A
quantile-quantile plot^[Quantile-quantile plots compare the quantiles estimated from the
distribution fitted to the data with the corresponding empirical quantiles.] comparing quantiles estimated from the Gumbel
distribution to empirical quantiles^[The empirical quantiles were estimated using the Cunnane quantile estimator.] is shown in @fig-A7b. It can be
seen that the agreement between the empirical quantiles and those of the
Gumbel distribution is satisfactory and, therefore, one can conclude
that the fitted Gumbel distribution adequately represents the series of
annual daily precipitation maxima at the Jean-Lesage Airport station.
