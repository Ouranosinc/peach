This folder contains notebooks to access and process data required for water level indicators. The notebooks were developped by Lea Brashi @leabraschi. For more information please refer to the CBCL report presented on the [project website](https://www.ouranos.ca/fr/projets-publications/outils-analyses-risques-infrastructures).

The module `idf.py` constructs extreme precipitation indicators coded by David Huard @huard from the methodology developed by Alain Mailhot's team at INRS (for more information refer to their report on the  [project website](https://www.ouranos.ca/fr/projets-publications/outils-analyses-risques-infrastructures)).
